# Can bridges forward ROS CAN messages to/from the Linux SocketCAN interface
# These correspond one-to-one with the SocketCAN interfaces outputted when running "ip link"

# We use the PEAK PCAN-M.2 card for interfacing with the CAN bus and has four buses
# This driver: https://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm was compiled on the Jetson
# It makes the SocketCAN interfaces show up in "ip link"
